    <!-- Project Description -->
    <section class="card">
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>  From the beginning, I knew that I didn't want to try and make some kind of new optical illusion, but I still wanted to do something original. So I thought it might be fun to overlay optical illusions on top of each other. I started with the scintillating grid illusion which was pretty easy to make, but I thought the repeating striations of the scintillating grid would be perfect for a moire pattern. </p>
    <p>  I'd also recently played a game that called back to the old screensaver that bounced around on your screen. I thought that might be fun to make, and the movement would help create the moire pattern. </p>
    <p>
At first I tried to use a for loop to draw a circle, erase a part of it, and then draw a smaller circle inside, etc until completetion, but I quickly learned that isn't how erase works. After messing around a bit more, I realized it would be way easier to use a bunch of thick stroke arcs instead. </p>
    <p>Once I got it moving, I thought it still wasn't that fun to look at, so I thought I might as well throw in another one. I could've made a function to handle their variables individually, but I figured since I'm only making two it's just more work for something no one else would see. I also gave them 3D glasses colors because I thought it felt like a similar effect. With two objects, the arcs create at proper moire pattern...sometimes. I ran into an issue where they would run in the same direction at the same speed which didn't produce the effect. To solve this, I doubled the speed of one of them and called it a day.</p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p>Honestly, this is really just a weird screensaver or some kind of strange website background. This doesn't really have any sort of useful or productive application.</p>
