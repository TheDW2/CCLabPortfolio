    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Roll over the bars to get the specific stats for that day's games</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I forgot to keep track of any sort of data this week, so I went looking for what sorts of data I had of my daily activies that would already have been recorded. Luckily, I remembered that at op.gg I can look up my accounts and track what games I'd played and whether I had won them or not. I also knew that recently I had been severely underperforming in my games, so I wanted to have a representation of how badly I had been doing this past week.</p>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>Clearly I had been losing a lot. There is definitely some data lost here, including things like my KDA, what champion I was playing, whether I was duoing with someone, which account I was on, what the average rank of the players in the game were, and how well I performed relative to the other players in the game. What I learned is that I have definitely been the main cause of my losses this past week, probably due to me not practing much at all the week before. I also tend to do other things while playing the games which I'm sure hasn't helped my performance. The main thing I wanted to do this assignment was to practice my object oriented programming which I haven't had to do in a while, so I'd say this was a success.</p>
